# Where REACT meets Drupal #

So this site is partially decoupled. React handles the rendering of some of the pages and drupal handles the routing
and data storage. This is the basics of how they work together to build pages.

1. Each route in drupal that has React on the page has an entry js file that is primarily associating a DIV with a
   React component render.

```javascript 1.8




```
